The role of computers in <em>education</em>
- Instruction delivery
- Instruction enabling

Instruction delivery
- Throw information at the student until he knows it all
- <span class="light">Don't let him go ahead unless he passes all tests</span>
- <span class="light">Throw data at the student and let him process it</span>
- <span class="light">Let the student derive information</span>

%
Instruction enabling
- The computer as the laboratory
- C programming can only be taught on a computer
- Playing with Math and Science on the computer

Language learning is natural
- Natural languages are learnt through living
- <span class="light">Learning is inherited from one's surroundings</span>
- <span class="light">Create virtual lands where the mother tongue is the topic to be learnt</span>
- <span class="light">Mathland, Physicsland, Poetryland</span>

Debugging one's mistakes
- Don't punish a child when he makes mistakes
- Teach him to debug
- Teach him to read other people's problems and debug them too
%
This is where Foss shines
<blockquote>FOSS is great for learning because the source code is available. Not just for reading, but for modification, and experimentation.</blockquote>
%
Use FOSS tools instead of proprietary ones
- Should we teach students specific tools or give them the ability to learn any tool?
- Should we NOT teach the current popular tools?
- Throw responsibility into the hands of students
%
<blockquote>Popularity begets Obsolescence</blockquote>
%
Academics and FOSS
- Academia spreads knowledge by publishing papers, results and findings.
- Foss is a solid implementation of these ideas
- Foss allows one to build on another's knowledge
- Foss allows verifiability - the basis of all scientific publishings
%
We need to foster this at the school level
- Students of higher classes can build tools for lower classes
- Students work in a virtual world for the topic they study
- Programming expertise is not required, but domain expertise is built
- Students learn by collaborating and studying others' implementations
%
Doing, teaching, collaborating
- Learning is fostered by doing, teaching and collaborating
- This is why Foss makes sense for education
- We have plenty of examples in computer science and bioinformatics
- Let's apply this to other fields too
