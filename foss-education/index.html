<li>Don't punish a child when he makes mistakes</li>

<h1>This is where Foss shines</h1>

<blockquote>FOSS is great for learning because the source code is available. Not just for reading, but for modification, and experimentation.</blockquote>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Use FOSS tools instead of proprietary ones</h1>
<ul>
<li>Should we teach students specific tools or give them the ability to learn any tool?</li>
<li>Should we NOT teach the current popular tools?</li>
<li>Throw responsibility into the hands of students</li></ul>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1></h1>
<blockquote>Popularity begets Obsolescence</blockquote>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Academics and FOSS</h1>
<ul>
<li>Academia spreads knowledge by publishing papers, results and findings.</li>
<li>Foss is a solid implementation of these ideas</li>
<li>Foss allows one to build on another's knowledge</li>
<li>Foss allows verifiability - the basis of all scientific publishings</li></ul>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>We need to foster this at the school level</h1>
<ul>
<li>Students of higher classes can build tools for lower classes</li>
<li>Students work in a virtual world for the topic they study</li>
<li>Programming expertise is not required, but domain expertise is built</li>
<li>Students learn by collaborating and studying others' implementations</li></ul>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Doing, teaching, collaborating</h1>
<ul>
<li>Learning is fostered by doing, teaching and collaborating</li>
<li>This is why Foss makes sense for education</li>
<li>We have plenty of examples in computer science and bioinformatics</li>
<li>Let's apply this to other fields too</li></ul>
