<p>
Webster defines collaboration as <q>working jointly with others or
together especially in an intellectual endeavour</q>.
</p>

<p>
In an increasingly online world, it is necessary to have tools that
allow online teams to work with each other in a productive manner. When
dealing with Online Learning as well, students need to be able to work
together and with a teacher to extract the most out of their course.  A
suitable replacement for regular student-teacher contact sessions and
group discussions needs to be employed.
</p>

<p>
In this report, we shall have a look at some existing tools for
collaboration, at the various features supported, standards, if any, and
what the future holds in store for users of collaborative technology.
</p>

<h2><a name="S1.">1.</a> The Current Scenario</h2>

<p>
There already exist several online learning management systems like
WebCT and Blackboard, that along with the content
management modules, also offer some collaborative tools.  Most of these
are limited to discussion boards, white-boards and chat rooms.
</p>

<p>
The corporate world on the other hand has been using collaborative
tools for several years to conduct business with non-local partners.
Several groupware management suites have been developed to serve these
needs. It is useful for the educational world to take a few tips from
the corporate world. 
</p>

<h3><a name="S1.1.">1.1.</a> Existing collaborative tools</h3>

<p>
We can classify collaborative tools into four broad categories based
on the kind of collaboration that they facilitate.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Communication
  <ul>
  <li>Asynchronous<br>
    <small>Email, Discussion Boards/Blogs, Mailing Lists, Usenet</small>
  </li>
  <li>Synchronous<br>
    <small>Chat, IM, MOO/MUD</small>
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Information Sharing<br>
  <small>Whiteboards, Shared documents, etc.</small>
</li>
<li>Co-development<br>
  <small>CVS, Wiki, SourceSafe</small>
</li>
<li>Integrated systems (Groupware)</li>
</ul>

<p>
No one tool can serve all the collaborative needs of a team.  We must look at
a combination of different classes of tools for effective collaboration
[<a href="#Cicognani_Maher_1997" class="ref">Cicognani &amp; Maher, 1997</a>].
</p>

<h4><a name="S1.1.1.">1.1.1.</a> Communication</h4>

<p>
Communication is the basic need for collaboration.  If the members
of a group cannot communicate with each other, then there is no group.
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, communication would happen as a meeting between all
or some of the group members, or a phone call between two members.  One
member of the team would document the ideas brought out in these
meetings (the minutes of the meeting) and distribute them to all members
of the team.
</p>

<p>
Often, a team would have a bulletin board (a physical board) that
they would use to pass asynchronous messages to each other.  Leaving a
message on another member's answering machine or a post-it note at his
desk was also possible.
</p>

<p>
A computer based communication tool that replaces this must
therefore provide
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a means for two or more persons to communicate with each other,</li>
  <li>a means for permanently recording the content of this
communication,</li>
  <li>a means to distribute this content amongst the entire team,</li>
  <li>a means to protect this information, if required, from persons
who are not part of the team.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally, this communication needs to be synchronous or
asynchronous.
</p>

<p>
<h5>Asynchronous communication</h5>
tools include email, discussion boards and BBSes, mailing lists, Usenet,
etc.  Asynchronous communication is extremely important when groups are
geographically distributed [<a href="#Dufner_et_al_1999"
class="ref">Dufner et al., 1999</a>].
</p>

<p>
<strong>Email:</strong> Email [<a href="#RFC821" class="ref">RFC821</a>; <a href="#RFC2822" class="ref">RFC2822</a>] 
messages make up the bulk of all Internet based traffic.  From
a collaborative point of view, email is the primary mode of
communication between faculty and students and groups of students. Email
allows a faculty to respond at his or her own pace, but individual
emails from a large number of students can get overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
Although many would consider email to be a poor man's tool for
collaboration, it does have an important role to play [<a href="#Goldberg_2000" class="ref">Goldberg, 2000</a>].
</p>

<p>
<strong>Discussion Boards:</strong> Discussion
Boards allow users to post messages in a shared area.  The board may be
public, or private to a group.  All messages are visible to everyone,
and anyone may respond to a message, although some boards may be
moderated. Threads of discussion often ensue.  The advantage for the
faculty is that duplication of queries is reduced.  There is also a
chance that other knowledgeable students will respond, thereby reducing
the load of the teacher.  On the other hand, students with confidence
problems may feel intimidated by the public nature of a discussion
board, and stay away from it.
</p>

<p>
Many tools include discussion boards as part of the system. Examples
include Discus, Squishdot, MyPHPBoard, OpenBulletinBoard, and integrated
solutions like Moodle, Sourceforge.net, TUTOS. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mailing Lists:</strong> A mailing list
[<a href="#RFC2919" class="ref">RFC2919</a>] is similar to a discussion
board, except that access is via an email program rather than over the
web.  It is more convenient if one has easier access to email than to the
web, but results in higher Internet traffic.  Web based archives for
mailing lists makes it easier to gain read-only access to messages.
When posting, one must be mindful of Netiquette Guidelines 
[<a href="#RFC1855" class="ref">RFC1855</a>]
</p>

<p>
The most popular mailing lists in use today are Mailman, Majordomo
and LISTSERV. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Listserv</strong> <a
 href="http://www.lsoft.com/products/default.asp?item=listserv">http://www.lsoft.com/products/default.asp?item=listserv</a>
</p>

<p>
Listserv is a commercial mailing list software, useful for
Intranets, for setting up newsletter lists, discussion groups and direct
marketing campaigns.  There is also Listserv Lite from the same
company.
</p>

<p>
Pricing information for lite is available on the website, while for
Listserv, is available via phone from the company.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mailman</strong> <a
 href="http://www.list.org/">http://www.list.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
Mailman is arguably the most popular mailing list manager in use on
the Internet today.  Many sites have converted from Majordomo to
Mailman. Mailman is written in python, and uses pipermail for archiving.
It is highly customisable, and users can choose to use their own
templates and archiver.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Majordomo</strong> <a
 href="http://www.greatcircle.com/majordomo/">http://www.greatcircle.com/majordomo/</a>
</p>

<p>
Majordomo has been around for a long time and has evolved over the
years. It is written in perl and is highly customisable.  Customising
certain advanced features may be complicated, but this is being worked
on.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Usenet:</strong> Usenet is a net-wide
network of news servers based on NNTP [<a href="#RFC977" class="ref">RFC977</a>], each hosting several
news and user groups.  Messages are posted to and read from your local
news server, while news servers communicate regularly to exchange
messages [<a href="#RFC1036" class="ref">RFC1036</a>] in bulk over the ether.  The advantage of newsgroups
is that the information is accessible from wherever you are.  On the
other hand, many news servers get flooded with spam, and come under the
Usenet Death Penalty (UDP).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Google groups</strong> (<a
 href="http://groups.google.com/">http://groups.google.com/</a>)
provides one of the easiest web interfaces to Usenet
</p>

<p>
Google provides a web interface to most newsgroups.  They have also
archived and indexed all posts for several years.  Google took over
Dejanews and inherited their entire database.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Blogs:</strong> Although Blogs have been around for only five years,
[<a href="#Blood_2000" class="ref">Blood, 2000</a>] they have already created 
a major impact on the web.  Google has problems with indexing blog pages 
turning up several empty pages among the top results.
</p>

<p>
Blogs are used primarily to publish links to sites that one finds interesting,
but many people also use them to publish their thoughts.  As such, blogs
could be well utilised in an online learning scenario, with experts on a topic
posting their thoughts, and others commenting on them.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Blogger</strong> (<a
 href="http://www.blogger.com/">http://www.blogger.com/</a>)
was one of the first publicly usable blogs.  Updates are via the web interface.
Requires no knowledge of HTML.  Offers standard features including spell 
checking, archiving, post dating, etc.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Blosxom</strong> (<a
 href="http://www.blosxom.com/">http://www.blosxom.com/</a>)
is a lightweight weblog application.  It's biggest plus point is how easy
it is to extend blosxom with plugins.  The main system is only 150 lines of
code, and it has a large plugin library.
</p>

<p>
<strong>LiveJournal</strong> (<a
 href="http://www.livejournal.com/">http://www.livejournal.com/</a>)
A web based journalling system, users may get either a paid account, or must
be invited by an existing user.  Users can build communities.  Additional
features include a Friends page, where the latest stories from blogs on people
in your friends list are included.  Livejournal also has several clients that
allow updating of a journal without using the web interface.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Movable Type</strong> (<a
 href="http://www.movabletype.org/">http://www.movabletype.org/</a>
can be installed on your own site.  Offers features like categorisation,
and IP blocking.
</p>


<p>
<h5>Synchronous communication</h5>
tools include chat, instant messaging, whiteboards, MUDs, MOOs, etc. 
While chat and IM are simple user to user text communication, MUDs and
MOOs create entire environments for users to participate in.  Users may
take on avatars to indicate their personalities.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Chat:</strong> There are many forms of
Chat, IRC being the most common.  Chat allows many users to communicate
with each other in a single chat room.  Conversations can get chaotic as
the number of users increase.
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">IRC
</p>

<p>
Internet Relay Chat [<a href="#RFC1459" class="ref">RFC1459</a>; <a href="#RFC2810" class="ref">RFC2810</a>; <a href="#RFC2811" class="ref">RFC2811</a>; <a href="#RFC2812" class="ref">RFC2812</a>; <a href="#RFC2813" class="ref">RFC2813</a>] is
the most widespread chat protocol available on the Internet.  It allows
for the creation of chat rooms and for any number of users to
participate in one or more rooms.  Some Chat servers require
registration. Popular chat servers are: Talkcity, openprojects, etc.
</p>

<p>
<strong>IM:</strong> Instant Messaging started
in the early '80s with the Unix network talk program.  In recent years,
it has gained in popularity with companies like ICQ, AOL, Yahoo and
Microsoft all providing their own IM protocols that vary widely. IM has
created new means of socialising among groups [<a href="#Nardi_et_al_2000" 
class="ref">Nardi et al., 2000</a>].
</p>

<p>
<strong>IMPP</strong>
</p>
<p>
Instant messaging presence protocol [<a href="#RFC2778" class="ref">RFC2778</a>; <a href="#RFC2779" class="ref">RFC2779</a>] is a draft (currently 
in RFC stage) for Instant Messaging.  Most IM companies do not follow this 
standard.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Jabber</strong> <a
 href="http://www.jabber.org/">http://www.jabber.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
Jabber is an open XML protocol [<a href="#Saint_Andre_Miller_2003"
class="ref">Saint-Andre &amp; Miller, 2003</a>] for the real-time
exchange of messages and presence between any two points on the Internet.
The first application of Jabber technology is an asynchronous, extensible
instant messaging platform, and an IM network that offers functionality
similar to legacy IM systems such as AIM, ICQ, MSN, and Yahoo. Unlike the
other protocols, the Jabber protocol is open and extensible.
Additionally, the network is decentralised, with anyone allowed to host
their own server. A server may be located internal to a local area
network, making it ideal for private messaging applications.
</p>

<p>
<strong>MSN</strong> <a
 href="http://messenger.msn.com/">http://messenger.msn.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
MSN messenger appears to be the most popular IM client around.  This
is possibly so because most people get an account with MSN messenger
when they sign up for a hotmail account.  Contrary to popular belief, it
isn't necessary to have a hotmail account to get a MSN Messenger
account. One only requires a valid MSN Passport.
</p>

<p>
The current version of the MSN IM protocol is closed, but there are
unofficial guides [<a href="#Mintz_2002" class="ref">Mintz, 2002</a>]
about it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Yahoo </strong><a
 href="http://messenger.yahoo.com/">http://messenger.yahoo.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
Along with MSN messenger, Yahoo seems to be the most popular IM tool
around. Apart from the regular features, Yahoo also allows invisible
login and messaging.  Yahoo also has a chat interface with the Yahoo
Chat servers. One needs to register a yahoo id to be able to use Yahoo
messenger. Registering for a yahoo mail account automatically gives you
a yahoo id.
</p>

<p>
The current version of the Yahoo Messenger protocol is closed, but there are
unofficial documents [<a href="#Mani_2002" class="ref">Mani, 2002</a>; 
<a href="#Tellis_2002" class="ref">Tellis, 2002</a>] about it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>MUDs and MOOs:</strong> 
A MUD (Multiple User Dungeon [<a href="#MUD_FAQ1.1" class="ref">MUD FAQ 1.1</a>])
is a computer program, that users can log into and explore. Each user takes 
control of a computerised persona/avatar/incarnation/character. You can walk 
around, chat with other characters, explore dangerous monster-infested areas, 
solve puzzles, and even create your very own rooms, descriptions and items.
</p>

<p>
MOO (Multi-User Domain Object Oriented) is a computer program that allows 
multiple users to connect via the Internet to a shared database of rooms 
and other objects and interact with each other and the database in 
synchronous time.
</p>

<p>
Although MUDs and MOOs originated as games, their multi user nature lends
them well for any kind of collaboration [<a href="#Mehlenbacher_et_al_1994"
class="ref">Mehlenbacher et al., 1994</a>] - one only needs to design the correct
environment.  Instead of monster-infested dungeons, one could design schools
and colleges, with classrooms, canteens, corridors, and in fact, a complete
virtual university.  The use of MUDs in education is not new [<a
href="#Fanderclai_1995" class="ref">Fanderclai, 1995</a>], with work dating
back to 1993.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to get lost in a MOO if one jumps right in, but useful guides
[<a href="#Holmevik_Haynes_2000" class="ref">Holmevik &amp; Haynes, 2000</a>]
and FAQs [<a href="#MUD_FAQ" class="ref">MUD FAQ</a>]
exist to help the novice.
</p>

<p>
MUDs and MOOs are text based, but adding a 3D graphical shell around them
could make use more intuitive [<a href="#Prince_et_al_2002" class="ref">Prince et al., 2002</a>].
</p>

<p>
MUDs and MOOs that we've reviewed are:
</p>

<p>
<strong>AIME</strong> <a href="http://aime.sourceforge.net/"
>http://aime.sourceforge.net/</a>
</p>
<p>
The Advanced Interactive Mudding Environment is a text based MUD engine with
and Object Oriented design, built in C++.  It has some predefined environments
and also a builder section where one can build ones own environments.
</p>

<p>
<strong>SMM++ Mud Client</strong> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/smm/"
>http://sourceforge.net/projects/smm/</a>
</p>
<p>
SMM++ Mud Client is a graphical Mud Client with a text interface and mapping
capabilities.  While navigation through the mud is done through textual
commands, like in all other MUDs, the graphical interface does display a
map of the entire environment to make navigation easier.
</p>

<h4><a name="S1.1.2.">1.1.2.</a> Information Sharing (document sharing, whiteboards, etc.)</h4>

<p>
<strong>Document Sharing:</strong> Document sharing tools allow multiple people to
see and sometimes, edit the same documents.  One has the option of either placing
your documents in a publicly viewable location, e.g., your website, where others
can view them, or in a publicly editable location.  Wikis may be used for shared
document editing.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Whiteboards:</strong> A whiteboard is
a drawing area that can be shared across the network.  Participants in
the whiteboard meeting can all view and make changes to the drawing -
depending on permissions.
</p>

<p>
Many integrated tools include whiteboards as part of their collaborative 
suites. See the section on integrated systems for more of these. Among specific
whiteboard applications are:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Babylon</strong> (<span
 style="font-weight: normal;"></span><a
 href="http://www.visopsys.org/andy/babylon/">http://www.visopsys.org/andy/babylon/</a>)
provides a simple whiteboard and chat interface. Written in Java,
it has a separate client and server. It may be deployed on a
local network. The client may also be run as a Java applet
embedded in your browser window.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Coccinella</strong> (<a
 href="http://hem.fyristorg.com/matben/">http://hem.fyristorg.com/matben/</a>)
adds whiteboard functionality to Jabber.  The whiteboard is a
shared desktop, that supports text, drawings, images and
multimedia.  Additional formats can be added through
plugins.  Coccinella is written in Tcl/Tk.<br>

</p>

<p>
<strong>DrawBoard</strong> (<a
 href="http://drawboard.sourceforge.net/">http://drawboard.sourceforge.net/</a>)
is a java applet used to make graphical teleconferences, much like
Microsoft Netmeeting.
</p>

<h4><a name="S1.1.3.">1.1.3.</a> Co-Development (CVS, wiki, etc.)</h4>

<p>
<strong>CVS:</strong>
is a document versioning system usable by multiple users simultaneously.
It allows several persons to work on the same code base, automatically resolving
conflicts in edits.  A good logging mechanism allows developers to browse through
the version history of any document in the system.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft provides a similar product called Visual SourceSafe.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wiki:</strong> The WikiWikiWeb (<a
 href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki/">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki/</a>)
is a place where anyone may edit a document online.  Anyone may create, edit or
delete a document.  The advantages of Wikis are that the collective knowledge
of many experts may be harnessed.  On the negative side however, there is no
security, which means pranksters can also do anything.
</p>

<p>
Wiki has been extremely successful, and there's even an encyclopaedia [<a href="#Wikipedia" class="ref">Wikipedia</a>]
developed internationally using Wiki.
</p>

<h4><a name="S1.1.4.">1.1.4.</a> Integrated systems (Groupware)</h4>

<p>
Group support systems and groupware tools can help in the management of an
online course and provide an integrated approach to collaboration.
While research findings regarding the impacts of GSS on learning performance 
are somewhat mixed, early indications are encouraging and suggest that GSS 
may have a positive impact under certain situations
[<a href="#Tyran_Sheperd_2001" class="ref">Tyran &amp; Sheperd, 2001</a>].
</p>

<p>
Following are some of the integrated systems studied:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Amphora Light</strong> <a
 href="http://www.amphora.ee/freeware/">http://www.amphora.ee/freeware/</a>
</p>

<p>
Amphora Light is an open-source Web-based groupware server written in Python 
and Zope. It offers basic office functionality: document sharing, calendars, 
tasks, contacts, discussion, internet databases and Web email in the context 
of a hierarchical organisation and flexible access rights.
</p>

<p>
<strong>BioCoRE</strong> <a
 href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/biocore/">http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/biocore/</a>
</p>

<p>
BioCoRE is a collaborative work environment for biomedical research, research 
management, and training. It offers scientists (working together or alone) a 
seamless interface to a broad range of local and remote technologies such as 
discipline-specific and general tools, data, and visualisation solutions. It 
features powerful yet easy-to-use tools, among them co-authoring papers and 
other documents, running applications on supercomputers, sharing molecular 
visualisation over the Internet, notifying project team members of recent 
project changes by email, chatting, keeping a lab book, and other practical 
features.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Group Office</strong> <a href="http://group-office.sourceforge.net/"
>http://group-office.sourceforge.net/</a>
</p>

<p>
Group office is an easy to use group ware suite, with a very clean user
interface.  Offers standard features of multiple users, sharing files,
scheduling, etc.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Moodle</strong> <a
 href="http://www.moodle.org/">http://www.moodle.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
Moodle aims to be a complete LMS.  It provides users with
communication tools, including discussion boards that can be made part
of a course.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Netmeeting</strong> <a
 href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/netmeeting/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/netmeeting/default.asp</a>
</p>

<p>
Microsoft Netmeeting is a real time collaboration and conferencing client.
It delivers a complete Internet conferencing solution for all Windows
users with multi-point data conferencing, text chat, whiteboard, and
file transfer, as well as point-to-point audio and video.  For Unix users,
a compatible client called GnomeMeeting exists.
</p>

<p>
<strong>OpenGroupware</strong> <a href="http://opengroupware.org/"
>http://opengroupware.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
OpenGroupware is touted as the missing link in the OpenOffice suite.  It offers
all standard group management options, including integration with Microsoft
Outlook, Ximian Evolution, Mozilla Calendar, Apple iCal and KDE KOrganiser.
Ease of installation varies from very easy (on Debian) to cumbersome (on
RedHat).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Sourceforge </strong><a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/">http://sourceforge.net/</a>
</p>

<p>
The Sourceforge site creates a collaborative development network. It
includes tools for communication - discussion forums and mailing lists,
for document sharing - documentation, patch, news submission, workflow
management - tracker, collaborative development - cvs, as well as email
and website space.
</p>

<p>
See also: <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">http://savannah.gnu.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
<strong>TUTOS</strong> <a
 href="http://www.tutos.org/">http://www.tutos.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
The ultimate team organisation software is a groupware management
system. It provides users with collaborative tools, as well as customer
relationship management tools.  An interesting feature included in TUTOS
is support for teams distributed over various timezones.
</p>

<h3><a name="S1.2.">1.2.</a> When to use what</h3>

<p>
Given the different types of collaborative tools available, how does one decide
which ones should be used, and when?  No one tool can provide all the
collaborative needs of a team [<a href="#Graveline_et_al_2000"
class="ref">Graveline et al., 2000</a>].  Depending on the situation, different

<h2><a name="S2.">2.</a> Issues to address</h2>

<h3><a name="S2.1.">2.1.</a> Elements of successful collaboration</h3>

<p>
There are 10 key elements [<a href="#Hall_1999" class="ref">Hall, 1999</a>] that influence the effectiveness of collaboration
between teams.  These apply regardless of whether the collaboration is computer mediated
or face to face.  These elements were outlined for the Intelligence Community, and
reflects the current scenario in corporate adoption of groupware tools.  The academic
community, while already ahead in the social aspects of adoption, can use these guidelines
to choose which groupware tools will offer the most benefit.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Culture of sharing.</strong>  For collaboration to succeed, all collaborators
must be willing to share ideas with the rest of the team.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Common goal.</strong>  The virtual team must have a common goal on which to focus.
Milestones can be met while targeting this goal.  All motivation is directed towards
achieving the goal.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Process and workflow.</strong>  The employment of a groupware solution must
be driven by business process and workflow, and not the other way around.  Find a
tool to meet a need.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Trust.</strong>  A virtual team can only succeed if the members trust each other
to provide reliable information, and proceed according to established protocol for the
team.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Rules of engagement.</strong>  Rules about how and when groupware systems are
going to be used need to be laid out and adhered to.  These need to take into account
the comfort levels of all team members with using these systems.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mutual benefit.</strong>  To become popular amongst users, a groupware tool
must hold a perceived benefit for the user that exceeds the effort needed to maintain
it.  For example, calendaring systems have to be beneficial to the persons who maintain
the calendar, and not just their managers.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Management support.</strong>  Management must be willing to communicate the
need for groupware management systems.  Resources need to be committed and successes
need to be acknowledged.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Team rewards.</strong>  Recognition and rewards have to be made to teams
and not to individuals.  Emphasis must be on teamwork rather than specialised
knowledge, information sharing rather than individual performance, co ordination
rather than restricted access to information.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Training.</strong>  Most users shy away from new tools because of lack of
training.  By providing useful training, adoption of groupware can be increased.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Critical mass.</strong>  Finally, a tool becomes self sustaining only once
it reaches critical mass.  After a certain number of users start to use it, others
will join in on their own.  It is important to encourage adoption until this
critical mass is achieved.
</p>


<h3><a name="S2.2.">2.2.</a> Issues for teachers</h3>

<p>
In CMC, a teacher's role is primarily as a facilitator and a moderator.  While
teachers may participate in discussions, these are generally at predefined times.
Most discussions will take place between students.  A teacher must take the role
of guiding students especially less able students [<a href="#Berge_Collins_1995b"
class="ref">Berge &amp; Collins, 1995b</a>], moderating discussions, and establishing
accepted use guidelines [<a href="#Lai_1998" class="ref">Lai, 1995</a>].
</p>

<p>
There may be cases of shy or students who lack self confidence.  It is the teacher's
role to encourage these students to participate in discussions.
</p>

<p>
CMC allows learners the freedom to explore alternative pathways-to find and
develop their own style of learning [<a href="#Berge_Collins_1995c"
class="ref">Berge &amp; Collins, 1995c</a>].  How do teachers cope with these
alternative pathways and changes in the use of technology to facilitate
learning?
</p>

<h3><a name="S2.3.">2.3.</a> Issues for students</h3>
<p>
Students need to be aware of Netiquette Guidelines [<a href="#RFC1855" class="ref">RFC1855</a>]
before participating in Usenet groups, Mailing lists, or Interactive Chat sessions.
The guidelines list several issues and how to deal with them.  In particular,
students need to mindful of the fact that without facial expressions and vocal
tone, it is hard to determine a person's mood while he types a message.  The
use of emoticons can help here.
</p>

<p>
CMC promotes self-discipline and requires students to take more responsibility
for their own learning [<a href="#Berge_Collins_1995a" class="ref">Berge &amp; Collins, 1995a</a>].
Very often, a student, or a group of students will have to interact with each other
without the presence of the teacher.  The teacher may simply provide access to
learning materials, but it is the student who has the responsibility of making
use of it.
</p>

<h3><a name="S2.4.">2.4.</a> Technical issues</h3>
<p>
The tools used will depend on the available technology.  Asynchronous textual
communication can take place over even slow links.  Real time communication may
require slightly faster links.  Voice and Video require high bandwidth and may
not be present in all places [<a href="#McDaniel_1996" class="ref">McDaniel, 1996</a>].
</p>
<p>
For a technology to gain widespread use, it must be affordable by its general
users [<a href="#Berge_Collins_1995c" class="ref">Berge &amp; Collins, 1995c</a>].
Other social issues can be tackled after the user has primary access.
</p>

<h3><a name="S2.5.">2.5.</a> Issues for designers of tools</h3>

<p>
As a designer of a CMC tool, one must keep in mind the final usefulness to the
users of a system.  CMC is a largely human oriented discipline, which leads to
several hard to solve problems.  We have a lot to learn from the areas of 
Computer-Human Interaction, and Psychology of users. One does need to understand
the personality of ones users.  Different kinds of people react differently to
the same stimuli [<a href="#Mishra_2002" class="ref">Mishra, 2002</a>].  How does
one build a system to satisfy everyone?
</p>

<p>
If people do not use, or only occasionally use a tool, then the usefulness of the
tool is questionable [<a href="#McDaniel_1996" class="ref">McDaniel, 1996</a>].  It is
likely that users will choose other means of communication - like a telephone - to
exchange information about each other.  A computer based tool must be able to replace
the usefulness and convenience of a similar non computer based tool in widespread use.
</p>

<p>
While it is the responsibility of a teacher or moderator to direct a discussion, 
intelligent CMCL environments can aid in this task.  Guidelines and recommendations
of educational researchers can be automated [<a href="#Kreijns_et_al_2002"
class="ref">Kreijns et al., 2002</a>].
</p>


<h3><a name="S2.6.">2.6.</a> Social Issues</h3>

<p>
CMC deals extensively with Humans, and social interactions [<a href="#Kreijns_et_al_2002" 
class="ref">Kreijns et al., 2002</a>] between users are a primary issue when designing
and using these tools.  Social issues can loosely be classified into the following four,
possibly overlapping criteria.  These will include issues for students, teachers and
designers alike.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Accessibility issues:</strong>
Persons with disabilities, physical impairment, disfigurement, or speech impediments, 
which hinder their equal participation in face-to-face encounters, do not face the
same problems in an online environment.  CMC promotes an equalisation of users
[<a href="#Berge_Collins_1995a" class="ref">Berge &amp; Collins, 1995a</a>] which
breaks through these barriers.  It is however important that any tools developed
follow accessibility guidelines [<a href="#WCAG" class="ref">WCAG</a>;
<a href="#US508" class="ref">US508</a>] specified by various standardisation bodies.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Cross-cultural issues:</strong>
CMC promotes collaboration between geographically and culturally diverse groups.
It is important to certain language constructs in one part of the world could have
very different meanings in other parts of the world.  Identifying what each of these
are is seldom possible for new comers.  In general, users must keep a cool head, and
get things clarified when in doubt.  It is a common practice in several companies to
have a standard list of unused words [<a href="#Medley_et_al_1998" class="ref">Medley et al., 1998</a>].
It must also be ensured that persons making up the majority of a group do not pick 
on minorities.  Judicious use of smileys/emoticons can help ease tensions and provide
visual cues that are taken for granted in face-to-face communication.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Ethical issues:</strong>
Whenever information is published on the Internet, several ethical issues come up.
As long as the group that publishes the information is controlled, it may be
possible to adhere to set guidelines.  In CMC, the users of the system are often
untrained students.  The possibility of copyrighted materials being published exists
and must be dealt with.  Copyright law is complicated and beyond the scope of this
report, but papers that explain the subject well [<a href="#Medley_et_al_1998"
class="ref">Medley et al., 1998</a>] may be referred to.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Privacy issues:</strong>
With centralised collaboration services, the issue of protection of a user's
data becomes important.  A user needs to be able to trust that the systems
he uses are safe and will protect his data from unauthorised access [<a
href="#Godefroid_et_al_2000" class="ref">Godefroid et al., 2000</a>].  There
is no worse deterrent for the adoption of a technology than the general 
perception that it invades the user's privacy.
</p>


<h2><a name="S3.">3.</a> Future Directions</h2>

<p>
<strong>Integration of Synchronous with Asynchronous:</strong>
The future of collaborative tools will see an integration of the synchronous 
with the asynchronous.  Online, synchronous, meetings may be carried on at a
later date using asynchronous tools.  Whiteboard sessions may be recorded and
played back, synchronised with any textual/audio conversation that may have
taken place at the time.
</p>

<p>
Some work is currently on to integrate instant messaging tools with mailing lists.
An online meeting will be logged, and the log mailed to the mailing list.  Further
meetings may refer to a thread in the mailing list.
</p>

<p>
<strong>3D Gaming Engines:</strong> may also be used as a collaborative medium.
Current engines like the ones from Quake
(<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/">http://www.planetquake.com/</a>), and
Unreal (<a href="http://www.planetunreal.com/">http://www.planetunreal.com</a>)
allow a user to redefine the worlds in which the game is played.  These may be
used to develop complete virtual universities with intuitive and interactive
graphical user interfaces.
</p>

<p>
These gaming engines have already been used in educational applications, relating
to interior design, architecture and modelling [<a href="#DeLeon_1999"
class="ref">DeLeon, 1999</a>; <a href="#Mindek_2002" class="ref">Mindek, 2002</a>],
and have the potential to expand into other areas of education too.
</p>

<p>
Research is currently underway to study  the social and communicative aspects of 
game play [<a href="#Manninen_2002" class="ref">Manninen, 2002</a>] and
collaborative browsing 
[<a href="#Setten_Moelaert_El_Hadidy" class="ref">Setten &amp; Moelaert-El Hadidy</a>]
</p>

<p>
<strong>Intelligent CMCL:</strong>
Research into Intelligent Computer Mediated Collaborative Learning environments is
still in its early stages.  Systems that can support the moderator by automating
guidelines and recommendations can prove extremely useful.  Additionally, evaluating
a student based on participation in the online classroom is also something that
would be worth automating.
