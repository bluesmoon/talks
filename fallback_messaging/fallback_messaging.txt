How do you chat?
- Which IM programs do you use?
- How many accounts on each?
- Do you communicate with the same people over multiple services?
- How often do you use email/SMS to communicate with these people?
%
Does the server decide whether you can chat or not?
- How often has a service gone down for maintenance while you're in a conversation?
- What happens to your conversation?
- What happens to your train of thought?
- What happens to logs of the conversation - if any?
%
- Do you know your friends by their names or their handles?
%
Act 1, Scene 1, Take 1
- Philip and Manish are chatting on MSN about their project
- MSN server goes down
- Start Y!M, continue conversation
- Net goes down, only email working
- Send email/SMS saying that we can't chat anymore
- Philip combines all the logs to post to the website
%
The idea behind fallback messaging 
- People care about people, not protocols
- Conversations should not be service dependent
- Conversation should be continuous even if the service changes
- Person-person messaging approaches pc-pc messaging
%
So what does fallback messaging do?
- Automatically pick a protocol to use for messaging
- Automatically switch protocols if one goes down without worrying the user
- A single log file irrespective of protocol
- Represent a person as a single entity rather than a bunch of different handles
%
What's needed?
- A single client that talks multiple protocols
- The client should group different accounts of a contact into a single entity
- The client should be able to switch between accounts
- Perhaps an ability to prioritise the order of fallback
%
Act 1, Scene 1, Take 2
- Philip and Manish are chatting on MSN about their project
- MSN server goes down
- The client switches to Y!M
- Net goes down, only email working
- Client switches to email/sms
- User is notified that he's now in async mode
- The client has a combined log of everything communicated
%
Can we do this today?
- FOSS clients like gaim and ayttm can do it, though they might still need some work
- FOSS clients have the edge
%
Do we really need it?
- Probably in very few situations, but we sure want it :P
- Data transfer over IM is an application
%
The future of IM
- Everyone's talking about IM interoperability
- Sending structured data and not just human readable conversations over IM
- IM transports as a commodity with value added services above it
