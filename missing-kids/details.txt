Hey guys

 

Are you OK to take your presentations along on your own laptops tonight or prefer to forward them to me and I’ll take mine? Up to you but might be easier on one laptop either way. Happy to take mine as back-up as well!

 

Event runs from 6-9pm at The City Hotel on Kent St, imagine talks will start around 6:30pm and food arrive around 7:30pm or soon after depending on prezo timing. Sound OK?

 

I’ll leave the office around 5:15pm and walk to the venue to get set up, it’s about 15-20 mins away. Can join me or come a bit later if preferred.

 

We’ll use twitter #y7os – any chance you can put that on your into slides?
