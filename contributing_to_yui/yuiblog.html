<p>
In a little over a week from now, I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://foss.in/">FOSS.IN</a>
conference in Bangalore.  FOSS.IN is an annual conference in India with the aim of creating 
more FOSS contributors, in particular from India.  My talk will cover what it takes to
<a href="http://foss.in/2008/register/speakers/talkdetailspub.php?talkid=646">contribute to YUI</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you happen to be in Bangalore between November 25 and 29, drop in to the conference.  You can
have to <a href="http://foss.in/register/delegate-registration">register online</a> to get 50% off
on the conference fee.

<p>
Hope to see some of you there.
